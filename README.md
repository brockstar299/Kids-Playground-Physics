# Kids Playground Physics

**Kids Playground Physics** is an interactive 3D simulation where users can explore the physics behind playground equipment. Experience the motion of swings, slides, and other playground structures, and see how forces like gravity and friction influence their movement.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Playground**: Explore different pieces of playground equipment in a virtual environment.
- **Physics in Action**: See how concepts like gravity, motion, and friction affect how playground equipment moves.
- **Fun Exploration**: A playful way to see physics principles at work in everyday life.

## How to Use

1. Open the webpage or project in your browser.
2. Interact with the 3D simulation to see how different pieces of playground equipment behave.
3. Experiment with swings, slides, and more to observe real-world physics in action.

## Technologies Used

- **Spline**: Used to create the interactive 3D simulation.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic web technologies for embedding and styling the iframe.
